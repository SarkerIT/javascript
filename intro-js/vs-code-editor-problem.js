/* **Integrated Terminal in Visual Studio Code**:

1. **What is the Integrated Terminal?**
- Visual Studio Code includes a **full-featured integrated terminal** that starts at the root of your workspace.
- It provides integration with the editor, supporting features like **links and error detection**.
- The integrated terminal can run commands such as `mkdir` and `git`, just like a standalone terminal.

2. **How to Open the Terminal:**
- You can open a terminal in the following ways:
  - From the menu, use the **Terminal > New Terminal** or **View > Terminal** commands.
  - From the **Command Palette** (â‡§âŒ˜P or Windows/Linux Ctrl+Shift+P), use the **View: Toggle Terminal** command.
  - In the **Explorer**, use the **Open in Integrated Terminal** context menu command to open a new terminal from a folder.
  - To toggle the terminal panel, use the **âŒƒ`** (Windows/Linux Ctrl+`)** keyboard shortcut.
  - To create a new terminal, use the **âŒƒâ‡§`** (Windows/Linux Ctrl+Shift+`)** keyboard shortcut.

3. **Terminal Shells:**
- The integrated terminal can use various shells installed on your machine, with the default being pulled from your system defaults.
- Shells are detected and presented in the terminal profiles dropdown.

4. **Managing Terminals:**
- The terminal tabs UI is on the right side of the terminal view.
- Add terminal instances by selecting the **+** icon or triggering the **âŒƒâ‡§`** command.
- Remove terminal instances by hovering over a tab and selecting the Trash Can button or using other methods.
- Navigate between terminal groups using **focus next** (â‡§âŒ˜]) and **focus previous** (â‡§âŒ˜[).

5. **Groups (Split Panes):**
- You can place multiple terminals side-by-side and create a group by splitting a terminal.
- Ways to split a terminal:
  - Hover over an entry in the list of terminals and select the inline split button.
  - Right-click and select the **Split** menu option.
  - Alt-click on a tab, the + button, or the single tab on the terminal panel.
- The working directory for the new terminal depends on the `terminal.integrated.splitCwd` setting.

Remember, the integrated terminal in Visual Studio Code is a powerful tool for executing commands, managing tasks, and interacting with your workspace! ðŸš€
